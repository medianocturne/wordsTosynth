# wordsTosynth
HTML/CSS/Javascript project that converts typed ASCII text to synth sound via Web Audio API/Tone.js

<h1><strong>This is currently broken - proceed with caution!</strong></h1>

You should be able to get the 'gist' of it by entering a single, short word.  However anything that includes whitespace or multiple words, at this time, will likely cause results that you don't want. 

I will be getting back to this project soon, the 'audio overload' issue that I am observing (I think) is either coming from bad parameters in an effects chain or multiple instantiations of tone.js synths simultaneously.
